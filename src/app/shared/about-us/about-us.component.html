          Most junkyard owners do buy salvage vehicles from auctions or from towing zones or from individual sellers. They dismantle the usable parts from the vehicle and sell these parts via their stores or online selling platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is common for most junkyard owners where they have to use two separate platforms or websites for their business operations. There are very few websites from junkyard owners where they individually buy and sell in single place. But there is no unified platform for multiple junkyard owners to buy vehicle and sell parts.
        </p>
        <p>On the other hand, there are no unified platform for users to buy parts from different sellers and sell their salvage vehicle in same platform where multiple buyers are available</p>
